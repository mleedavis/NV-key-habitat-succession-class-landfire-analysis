# key-habitat-succession-class-landfire-analysis

This code analyzes data from the LANDFIRE program (https://landfire.gov/index.php) to obtain basic trends for changes in land cover and succession class status at the biophysical setting (BpS) level and 'key habitat' levels. BpSs are vegetation classifications based on state-and-transition models developed through the LANDFIRE program and represent 'vegetation system(s) that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement....'

'Key habitats' as defined here are aggregations of similar BpS that were developed to match management-level planning efforts; terminology for key habitats follows that generally utilized for State Wildlife Action Plans. To recreate this analysis for another area of interest the user must reclassify BpS for the area into similar habitat types () 

The following outputs are covered:
1) The percent of Nevada (or your area of interest)represented by each key habitat
2) The percent that each biophysical setting represents within each key habitat
3) The percent of each key habitat converted to non-natural vegetation,agricultural use, urban, and barren or sparse
4) The difference in historic versus current succession class within each biophysical setting (BpS)
